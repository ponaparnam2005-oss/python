An apple is a round, edible fruit produced by the apple tree (*Malus domestica*), one of the most widely cultivated fruit trees in the world. Apples come in a variety of colors—most commonly red, green, or yellow—and flavors ranging from sweet to tart, depending on the variety. They are rich in dietary fiber, vitamin C, and antioxidants, making them both nutritious and refreshing. Often eaten fresh, apples are also used in countless culinary applications such as pies, juices, sauces, and salads. With their crisp texture and satisfying juiciness, apples have been cherished for centuries, not only for their taste and health benefits but also for their cultural symbolism, representing knowledge, temptation, and abundance in various traditions.
